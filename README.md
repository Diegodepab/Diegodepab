### Greetings, everyone!! 
My name is Diego De Pablo. I'm currently a health engineering student (a field that encompasses aspects of biomedical and systems engineering) with a focus on bioinformatics. 

As an aspiring bioinformatics professional. I'm passionate about learning and expanding my knowledge in various programming languages, including Python, MATLAB, Java, and R. While completing my university education. (à¸‡ï¸¡'-'ï¸ )à¸‡

I aim to stay actively involved in programming and engage in more direct interactions with projects, challenges, and the work of others. I seek to complement my academic learning with hands-on experience and gain both technical skills and soft skills that enhance my professional profile and facilitate teamwork.ðŸ«¡ðŸ˜„
