My name is Diego De Pablo. I'm currently a health engineering student (a field that encompasses aspects of biomedical and systems engineering) with a focus on bioinformatics.🌱 

I aim to stay actively involved in programming and engage in more direct interactions with projects, challenges, and the work of others. I seek to complement my academic learning with hands-on experience and gain both technical skills and soft skills that enhance my professional profile and facilitate teamwork.😄
