My name is **Diego De Pablo**. I'm currently a *health engineering student* (a field that encompasses aspects of biomedical and systems engineering) with a focus on bioinformatics.🌱 

I aim to stay actively involved in programming and engage in more direct interactions with projects, challenges, and the work of others. I seek to complement my academic learning with hands-on experience and gain both technical skills and soft skills that enhance my professional profile and facilitate teamwork.😄
